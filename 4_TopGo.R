    # 4) annotationFun: function which maps genes identifiers to GO terms. There are a couple of annotation function included in the package trying to address the userâ€™s needs. The annotation functions take three arguments. One of those arguments is specifying where the mappings can be found, and needs to be provided by the user. annFUN.gene2GO this function is used when the annotations are provided as a gene-to-GOs mapping.
