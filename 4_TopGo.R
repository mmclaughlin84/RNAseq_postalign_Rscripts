# 3) nodeSize: (optional) This parameter is used to prune the GO hierarchy from the terms which have < nodeSize # of annotated genes.
# 4) annotationFun: function which maps genes identifiers to GO terms. There are a couple of annotation function included in the package trying to address the userâ€™s needs. The annotation functions take three arguments. One of those arguments is specifying where the mappings can be found, and needs to be provided by the user. annFUN.gene2GO this function is used when the annotations are provided as a gene-to-GOs mapping.

# Step 4: Test for significance, correct for multiple tests
###################

# TopGo takes the GO hierarchy into account when calculating enrichment, avoiding 'inheritance' problems where general GO terms and their subterms are all significant
# Two methods described, 'elim' and 'weight'
# Elim discards genes with significantly enriched descendant terms
# Weight compares significance scores of connected nodes
# Classic tests each GO term independently
# However: 'weight01' is the default method and is a mixture of the elim and weight methods
TopGOdata_weight_fisher_result <- runTest(TopGOdata, algorithm='weight01', statistic='fisher') 

# generate a table of results: GenTable function for summary table with the results from tests applied to the topGOdata object
allGO <- usedGO(TopGOdata)
all_res <- GenTable(TopGOdata, weightFisher=TopGOdata_weight_fisher_result, orderBy='weightFisher', topNodes=length(allGO))

?GenTable

# Generally, the p-values returned by enrichment methods in topGO are interpreted as corrected or not affected by multiple testing.
# However, one can perform an adjustment of the p-values if they consider that it is important for their analysis.
# Note: It is important to mention that for the methods that account for the GO topology, the problem of multiple testing is complicated.
# Here, one computes the p-value of a GO term conditioned on the neighbouring terms. The tests are therefore not independent and the multiple testing theory does not directly apply.

# fdr (Benjamini & Hochberg / BH) adjusted p-values
# cbind p.adj to results table above
# select only if <=0.05
p.adj <- p.adjust(all_res$weightFisher, method="fdr")
